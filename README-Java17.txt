Java 17 information 22au, 23sp

The lab machines have Java 17 installed, and we will use that to run
and test your projects.  If your local machine is using Java 11 or newer
you should be fine, but we recommend that you update to Java 17 unless
you have a reason not to do that.  If, for some reason, you have a more
recent version of Java installed, you should be very careful to be sure
that your code works using only language features and libraries available
in Java 17.  Your IDE (for instance, IntelliJ) should be able to help with
this by using appropriate language compatibility level settings.

If you have a Windows machine, before installing Java 17, we strongly
recommend that you use the Windows control panels to remove all older
versions of Java, which will minimize the potential for problems or
confusion that can happen when multiple versions of Java are installed. 
If you have a Mac, you normally do not need to remove older versions of
Java, but, if you wish, open a terminal window and use the command
"cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/" to find the directory where Java
is located.  Then use "sudo rm -rf ..." to remove the older Java
installations that you no longer want.

Once that is done, use the openjdk link on the CSE 401/M501 resources
web page and download the appropriate Adoptium installer for Java 17. 
Run the installer and, particularly on windows, select all the options
to update environment variables and perform a clean install that should
have minimal problems.
